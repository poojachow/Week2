K reverse linked list: 
Given a singly linked list and an integer K, reverses the nodes of the
list K at a time and returns modified linked list.

Sort List:
Sort a linked list in O(n log n) time using constant space complexity.

Anagrams:
Given an array of strings, return all groups of strings that are anagrams. Represent a group by a list of integers representing the index in the original list. Look at the sample case for clarification.

Substring Concatenation:
You are given a string, S, and a list of words, L, that are all of the same length.
Find all starting indices of substring(s) in S that is a concatenation of each word in L exactly once and without any intervening characters.
